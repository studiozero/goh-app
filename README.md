##Get Over Here

<img align="center" height="300" src="public/app/images/icon-512.png">

Inspired by the 'Dumb App' Lookfor - http://www.lookfor.cl/ - This is Get Over Here, a web app ready for you to use to help your friends find where you is at. Just open the app and tap/click the screen and stick your beacon of light, hope and possibly an epilepsy enducing flicker into the air.

Get Over here runs on the web, so you can access it on most devices that have a browser, but you can also save it to your mobile/tablet device by adding it to your homescreen. This should enable this dumb app to run on more than just Android and iOS, I mean I've not tested in all these places but IEMobile, FFOS and Kindle should be good. If it's got a decent browser it should work - if it doesn't, submit a issue and/or pull request for the fix.


Get Over here also runs offline.

It is released under a ISC(MIT) license.
